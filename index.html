                        <p class="story">Not quite a first date, but first meeting before first date, which was messy but led to marriage in 8 months.</p>
                        <p class="story">I was living in San Francisco and it was during the City’s Indian summer (August/September). She was a friend to a roommate. She was reclined, in shorts and bikini top, sunning herself. All were casually being social. Said roommate was massaging her foot. Everything about her intrigued me: blonde, blue eyes, attractive, not self-conscious, interesting conversation, intelligent… you get the picture. Intrigued enough to be willing to say or do something… anything, and not have a clue what to do or say. I approached, roommate still busy working the kinks out of her foot. I looked at her, then him, then her foot…</p>
                        <p class="story">Me: (to her) “You have athlete’s foot”</p>
                        <p class="story">Roommate: “Oh, gross. Yuck” and leaves her foot behind and moving away.</p>
                        <p class="story">Her: (looking at me with an absolute WTF stare)</p>

                        <p class="story">Me: (Looks at roommate, looks at her feet, then him, then her) “Look. It’s not really that big of a deal. All you need to do is wash-up with soap-and-water when you’re done” (looked at him again noting no sign of returning and then at her feet)</p>
                        <p class="story">Me: (lowers myself to my knees) “No big deal at all” (looking at feet, taking one, and begins massaging her foot, picking up where roommate left off)</p>
                        <p class="story">Me: (maybe half a minute into massaging her foot, looking up, catching her eyes) “Hi, I’m David. You’re… ?”</p>
                        <p class="story">She shared her name. At some point within two weeks, we did the first date. Again, clueless because I’d never run into anyone before that left me without words, made me feel all-thumbs, and clumsy and dumb. Naturally, being in that state and walking several miles to where we chose to do dinner, I forgot my wallet. Somehow, I gained composure around her and managed to start saying things that made sense. After several months, we got a place together. Several more months, we talked marriage. Neither of us were opposed to the idea so we went ahead and got our license. Beyond that, no clear ideas or plans. I’d probably just keep going along as we were for a long time.</p>
                        <p class="story">A few months later, she nailed me with a dare. Worse still, a double-dare to get married in an hour’s time. It took about an hour-and-a-half, but thumbing through the yellow pages and making hurried calls, found a non-denomination priest(es) to meet us in the rose garden in Golden Gate Park as dusk approached, with 2 witnesses in tow. We kept the marriage alive for 20 years and we remain good friends, still scribbling letters back-and-forth, sending birthday/x-mas gifts back-and-forth, and occasionally visiting when vacation time allows. We were and remain, good friends.</p>
                        <p class="story">Looking back, the whole thing was kind of quirky and dear and in it’s own way, seems kinda romantic. I mean, really, how many can make the claim their moment of marriage took place on a double-dare that ended up, strangely enough, in a metropolitan city’s official rose garden, not to mention said roses were in bloom? All of it because she had a fungal infection that I was stupid enough to point out…</p>
